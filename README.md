> This Project is mainly for me as I learn and dive more into the cybersecurity field. I have a particular interest in learning about Ethical Hacking So im sure the main or at least the first portion of this will involve Offensive Cybersecurity methods. That being said I want to learn as much as I can so potentially in the future I want to incorporate more blue teaming as well to become well balanced.

# Open Source Intelligence Gathering

> Open Source Intelligence or OSINT is sort of your first method into gathering information about a client, website, or target. It's considered a passive way to gather information as your not actually interacting with the network / website but rather gathering information from a third party. Luckily there are a lot of tools that are able to assist in this process. Such as Search enginges, Goog-mail.py, API's, and more.

## OSINT Tools

* .[Goog.mail.py](#Goog-mail.py).


### Goog-mail.py

This is a script used to search google for email address. As with any script that you might find yourself downloading off the internet, make sure to read the source code to know exactly what it's doing and if it could potentially harm your computer.  By using Goog-mail.py you can target a specific domain. In this example the target is Uk arm of IBM. if we type in uk.ibm.com in our script it would scrape information based on the uk.ibm.com domain we specficed. You can then save this document, and use later as it could be helpful for phsing emails and other malware entrypoints. It's also important to verify the information gathered by the script manually as some of it can be outdated.
